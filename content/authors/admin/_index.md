Hello, I’m Jared Wason a ServiceNow Administrator living in Monterey, California. I have experience configuring and developing for IT Service Management, Service Catalog, Domain Separation, Service Portal, Integrations, Importing/Exporting Data, Asset Management, and other platform development. 

I have strong communication skills from working with various clients to gather their requirements and configure ServiceNow to their specifications. I am the team lead of three developers and trained two ServiceNow administrators.

When I’m not working, I enjoy being outside either running, hiking, playing basketball, or playing disc golf. If I am inside, I like to play video games with friends or read. I am currently reading Tortilla Flat by John Steinbeck.
