Hello, I'm Jared Wason a ServiceNow Admin and Developer living in Monterey, California. My areas of focus are ITSM & ITOM developments, 3rd Party Intergrations through APIs, and software quality aussrance/testing practices via the Automated Testing Framework.

When I'm not working, I enjoy being outside either running, hiking, playing basketball, or playing disc golf. If I am inside, I like to play video games with friends or read. I am currently reading Tortilla Flat by John Steinbeck.
